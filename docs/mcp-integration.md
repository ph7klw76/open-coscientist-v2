# MCP Integration & Literature Review

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration is **recommended** for best results. While Open Coscientist will work without it, the quality of hypotheses is significantly enhanced when grounded in real published research.

## Reference Implementation

The bundled MCP server in `mcp_server/` provides PubMed integration and serves as a starting point. The core engine is domain-agnostic: literature sources, prompt guidance, and post-generation enrichments are controlled by a YAML configuration — no code changes needed. See [Domain Customization](domain-customization.md) for working examples (biomedical, cybersecurity, multi-source academic).

## With MCP Server

Open Coscientist will:
- Automatically detect the MCP server at startup
- Search PubMed biomedical database for real published papers
- Retrieve fulltext XML/HTML from PubMed Central (PMC)
- Analyze literature with per-paper analysis and synthesis
- Use the Reflection node to validate hypotheses against actual research findings
- Generate hypotheses informed by current biomedical literature

**Limitations without MCP:**
- Relies solely on LLM's training data (limited awareness of recent discoveries)
- No validation against current scientific literature

## Setting Up MCP Server

### Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to get started is with Docker:

```bash
# 1. copy and configure environment
cp mcp_server/.env.example mcp_server/.env
# edit mcp_server/.env: set ENTREZ_EMAIL and ENTREZ_API_KEY

# 2. start server with docker compose from project root (open-coscientist/)
docker compose up -d

# 3. verify server is running
curl http://localhost:8888
```

MCP endpoints will be available at `http://localhost:8888/mcp` (auto-detected by Open Coscientist).

### Alternative: Local Development Setup

For local development without Docker:

```bash
cd mcp_server

# create Python 3.12+ environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -e .

# configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set ENTREZ_EMAIL, ENTREZ_API_KEY

# Run from root dir, to find the mcp_server package
cd ..

# run server (from root dir)
uvicorn mcp_server.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```

**For complete setup instructions, Docker commands, and configuration options, see [mcp_server/README.md](../mcp_server/README.md).**

### Required Environment Variables (See mcp_server/.env.example)

MCP server requires:
- `ENTREZ_EMAIL`: Your email (required for PubMed API)
- `ENTREZ_API_KEY`: For higher rate limits (get at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/)

## Generation Modes

Open Coscientist supports three generation modes with different levels of literature integration:

1. **No Literature Review** (Fastest) - Uses only LLM knowledge
2. **Literature-Informed Generation** - Pre-processes literature, then generates
3. **Tool-Calling Generation** - Generate node queries literature in real-time

**For detailed information on each mode, configuration examples, and when to use each, see [Generation Modes Documentation](generation-modes.md).**


## Bringing Your Own MCP Tools

Open Coscientist supports any MCP-compatible server via the YAML configuration system — no modifications to Open Coscientist code or prompts are needed. The YAML config handles:

- Registering your server URL and transport
- Defining tools (search, read, utility) with response parsing rules
- Mapping tool parameters to canonical names used by the workflow
- Injecting domain-specific prompt instructions per tool

Supported literature source types: `pubmed`, `academic`, `preprint`, `knowledge_graph`, `vulnerability_database`.

See [Literature Review Tools Configuration](literature_review_tools_configuration.md) for the full YAML schema reference, and [Domain Customization](domain-customization.md) for complete worked examples.

For implementing custom MCP tools, refer to the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
